description: Create custom API Modules and install them via the Vratix CLI into any Node.js project
---

**Private API Modules** allow developers to write, manage, and reuse custom backend API logic.  
You can publish private modules via the CLI or by connecting a GitHub repository through the Vratix dashboard.

## How Private API Modules Work

- Each user gets a **private registry** where they can publish and manage their API Modules.
- Modules can be created using the **Vratix CLI** or by linking a **GitHub repository**.
- Every module must include a valid [`manifest.json`](/docs/privateModules/manifest) file.
- Modules can depend on **Community API Modules** (Vratix Open Source API Library) or other private modules from your registry.
- Each module has a **size limit of 5MB**.

## Create Your Vratix Account

To create, publish, and install Private Modules, you need to create a [Vratix account](/auth).

When you sign up, we will create a **Private Registry** linked to your account, where all your custom API Modules will be stored.

## Authenticating Your CLI Session  

Before you can **publish** private modules or **install** them into your API projects, you need to authenticate your CLI session.  

Run the following command:  

```bash
npx vratix login
```

This will open a browser window where you can authorize the CLI to use your Vratix account.
Once authenticated, you can proceed with publishing and installing modules.

Your CLI session is **valid for 1 hour** after which you need to authenticate again. 

## Creating a New Private API Module

You can create a new API Module in two ways:

### Using Our GitHub Template

We provide a [GitHub template](https://github.com/vratix-dev/api-module-template) to quickly scaffold a new API Module.  
Fork the template, customize your module, and publish it using the CLI or by linking the repository to Vratix.

### Using the CLI

Run the following command:

```bash
npx vratix module new
```

This command will guide you through creating the basic structure of an API Module, including a `manifest.json` file.

### Example `manifest.json`

```json
{
  "key": "ios-billing-module",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "iOS Billing",
  "description": "A simple API module that integrates billing for iOS mobile apps",
  "typescript": true,
  "framework": "express",
  "folders": {
    "controllers": "controllers",
    "routes": "routes",
    "middleware": "middleware",
    "utils": "utils"
  },
  "registryDependencies": ["payments"],
  "communityDependencies": ["auth-basic"]
}
```

Learn more about configuring your module’s [`manifest.json`](/docs/privateModules/manifest).

You can also override the standard folder names, just like when creating a new API service with **Community Modules**.

## Publishing a Private API Module

There are two ways to publish a private module:

### Using a GitHub Repository

You can also publish modules by linking a GitHub repository to your account in the **Vratix Dashboard**.  
This ensures seamless source code updates on every push to the `main` branch.

**Note:** Only repositories with a valid `manifest.json` file can be imported to your private registry.

### Using the CLI

Once your module is ready, publish it with:

```bash
npx vratix module publish --private
```

This will upload your module to your **private registry**.

## Installing a Private API Module

Private modules published via the CLI or GitHub can be easily installed into your Node.js projects.

> ⚠ **Do not modify or move your `manifest.json` file**, as this may cause issues during installation.

To install a private module, run:

```bash
npx vratix add
```

You will first be asked if you want to add any **Community Modules**, then you can select from your **Private Registry**.

## Managing Dependencies

Private modules can depend on:

- **Community API Modules** (our Open Source API Library)
- **Other Private Modules** from your registry

Dependencies should be listed in `manifest.json`.  
When installing a module, the **Vratix CLI** will automatically resolve and install its dependencies.
