title: Manifest File
description: API Module configuration
---

Each Private API Module needs a `manifest.json` file which defines the module configurations used when installing the module via our CLI.

The `manifest.json` file is automatically created inside `.config/manifest.json` when you create a new API Module via the CLI.
If you create an API Module from scratch you need to make sure to add a valid manifest.json file so you can later add it to your Vratix registry.

## `key`

This is the unique identifier of every Private Module in your registry. 
When using the CLI, the `key` is generated from the module name you select.

```json
{
  "key": "your-module-key"
}
```

> This is unique across your account.

## `name`

This is the name of your module, it shows on the Vratix dashboard and CLI.

```json
{
  "name": "Your API Module"
}
```

## `description`

Short description of what the modules does. Shows up on the Vratix dashboard and CLI.

```json
{
  "description": "A simple API module that integrates some repetitive logic"
}
```

## `typescript`

Added for forward compatibility, this doesn't change anything.

```json
{
    "typescript": true | false
}
```

## `framework`

Added for forward compatibility, this doesn't change anything.

```json
{
  "framework": "express"
}
```

## `folders`

Just like when creating new Node.js services with the Community Modules, you can modify the default folder names of your API Module.

> You can have different folder names for your API Module and `folderOverrides` in your API project.
> The CLI will resolve any differences in imports and folder names automatically.

### `folders.controllers`

Specifies the folder path for storing controller files, where youâ€™ll implement business logic.

```json
{
  "folders": {
    "controllers": "controllers"
  }
}
```

### `folders.routes`

Defines the location for endpoint route files.

```json
{
  "folders": {
    "routes": "routes"
  }
}
```

### `folders.middleware`

Sets the path for middleware files, allowing you to configure custom middleware for Express.js.

```json
{
  "folders": {
    "middleware": "middleware"
  }
}
```

### `folders.utils`

Specifies where helper and miscellaneous utility scripts are stored.

```json
{
  "folders": {
    "utils": "utils"
  }
}
```

## `registryDependencies`

An array of **Private API Module** keys. Use this property to list any dependencies from **your private** Vratix registry.

The CLI will try to install all private dependencies when adding the API Module to a project.

```json
{
  "registryDependencies": ["payments", "scheduling-jobs"]
}
```

> Currently you need to add this manually and make sure the dependency modules exist.

## `communityDependencies`

An array of **Community API Module** keys. Use this property to list any dependencies from **the open source** Vratix registry (API Library).

The CLI will try to install all community dependencies when adding the API Module to a project.

```json
{
  "communityDependencies": ["auth-basic"]
}
```

> Currently you need to add this manually and make sure the dependency modules exist.

## Example `manifest.json`

```json
{
  "key": "ios-billing-module",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "iOS Billing",
  "description": "A simple API module that integrates billing for iOS mobile apps",
  "typescript": true,
  "framework": "express",
  "folders": {
    "controllers": "controllers",
    "routes": "routes",
    "middleware": "middleware",
    "utils": "utils"
  },
  "registryDependencies": ["payments"],
  "communityDependencies": ["auth-basic"]
}
```
