title: The CLI
description: Guide to using our CLI
---

Our CLI offers a quick, hassle-free way to set up a new project and install API modules with a single command.

While youâ€™re free to copy source code directly from our GitHub repo, the CLI significantly simplifies the setup process by automating file placements, dependency resolutions, and other configurations.

The "raw" source code of API modules in GitHub may appear complex if copied directly. This setup is intentional to make the CLI work but can be confusing when integrating manually.

Using the CLI ensures smooth installation by handling:
- Copying files from the module registry
- Installing schema validators and database repositories
- Resolving internal and external dependencies
- Adjusting `import` aliases in each file

## `init`

Use the `init` command to create a new project using our Node.js template or to add a `.config/modules.json` file to an existing project.

```bash
npx vratix init
```

This command installs the template, sets up `package.json`, and configures the project based on your choices. For details on this process, refer to the [Installation Guide](/docs/install).

### Options
```txt
Usage: vratix init|i [options]

Initialize project

Options:
  -c, --cwd <cwd>  The working directory. Defaults to the current directory.
  -h, --help       Display help for the command
```

## `add`

The `add` command allows you to add new API modules to your project. It checks if both `package.json` and `.config/modules.json` exist in the project directory. 
If these files are missing, use the [init](#init) command first.

```bash
npx vratix add <module>
```

This command installs all relevant files for the specified module, manages dependencies, and adjusts `import` statements as needed.

### Options
```txt
Usage: vratix add [options] [module...]

Add an API module to your project

Arguments:
  module           The name of the module you want to add

Options:
  -c, --cwd <cwd>  The working directory. Defaults to the current directory.
  -h, --help       Display help for the command
```

## `module [command]`

You can use the `module` commands to create and publish new API modules to your private registry. 

```bash
npx vratix module [command]
```

> **NOTE**: To publish API modules you need to authenticate your CLI session using the [`login`](#login) command

### Options
```txt
Usage: vratix module|m [options] [command]

Private module commands. Use them to create, validate and publish Private API Modules.

Options:
  -h, --help         display help for command

Commands:
  new                Create a new API Module, this will create the necessary files and directories for your new module.
  publish [options]  Publish your API Module to your Vratix registry.
  help [command]     display help for command
```

## `login`

To publish or install Private API Modules you need to authenticate your CLI session. To do this use the `login` command:

```bash
npx vratix login
```

This will open a browser window and ask you to verify an 8 character code shown in your terminal. The code will look something like this `6AF2-4CPI`. 
You need to have a Vratix account to be able to authenticate your CLI session. [Create a new account](/auth).

### Options
```txt
Usage: vratix login [options]

Authenticate your CLI session with your Vratix account.

Options:
  -h, --help  display help for command
```
